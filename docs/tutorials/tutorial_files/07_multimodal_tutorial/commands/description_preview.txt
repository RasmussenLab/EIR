Nibble is a 3+ month old ball of cuteness. He is energetic and playful. I rescue
d a couple of cats a few months ago but could not get them neutered in time as t
he clinic was fully scheduled. The result was this little kitty. I do not have e
nough space and funds to care for more cats in my household. Looking for respons
ible people to take over Nibble's care.
